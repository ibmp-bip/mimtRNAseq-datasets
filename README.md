# mimtRNAseq-datasets
This repository contains plant datasets formatted for use with mimtRNA-seq v1.3.x pipeline (https://github.com/nedialkova-lab/mim-tRNAseq).

## Selaginella kraussiana

The nuclear genome assembly version 2 (Liu et al., 2023, Current Biology 33, 4085â€“4097 - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.08.061) has been downloaded from https://sk.ccgg.fun/. The chloroplast reference genome has been downloaded from the NCBI website (accession: NC_040926.1). The tRNA were annotated with tRNAscan-SE version 2.0.5 and manually curated. The data is currently available on [plantRNA database](http://plantrna.ibmp.cnrs.fr/).  

## Arabidopsis thaliana

This dataset contains the manually curated tRNA from TAIR10 assembly which are available on [plantRNA database](http://plantrna.ibmp.cnrs.fr/).
